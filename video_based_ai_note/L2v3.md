  Here's the analysis of the runner's motion in binary relation format, incorporating all key concepts from your example:

```
[Position-Velocity-Acceleration Relations]
1. x(t) = bt² → v(t) = dx/dt = 2bt → a(t) = dv/dt = 2b
   - Unit chain: [b] = m/s² → [v] = m/s → [a] = m/s²
   - Differentiation chain: x → v → a

[Graphical Relations]
2. Position plot:
   - Parabola (x vs t) → slope = v(t)
   - Initial slope (t=0): 0 → v(0)=0
3. Velocity plot:
   - Linear (v vs t) → slope = a
   - Constant slope → constant a
4. Acceleration plot:
   - Horizontal line (a=2b)

[Physical Interpretation]
5. Runner's motion:
   - Increasing speed (v∼t)
   - Constant acceleration (a=const)
   - Matches F=ma for constant force

[Binary Relation Table]
| Quantity  | Relation           | Mathematical Form | Graphical Meaning  |
|-----------|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Position  | Base function      | x(t) = bt²        | Parabola           |
| Velocity  | dx/dt of position  | v(t) = 2bt        | Slope of x(t)      |
| Acceleration | dv/dt of velocity | a(t) = 2b         | Slope of v(t)      |
| Units     | Dimensional flow   | [b]=m/s²→[v]=m/s  | Derivative cascade |

[Key Observations]
6. Critical features:
   - Quadratic x(t) ⇒ linear v(t) ⇒ constant a(t)
   - Zero initial velocity (v(0)=0)
   - Constant acceleration (2b) throughout
   - Graphical slopes encode derivatives:
     * x(t) curvature → changing v(t)
     * v(t) linearity → constant a(t)
```

This representation:
1. Presents the complete derivative chain
2. Shows unit consistency throughout
3. Links graphical features to physical meaning
4. Organizes relations in clear tabular form
5. Highlights the constant acceleration characteristic

The binary relations explicitly show how each kinematic quantity derives from the previous one through differentiation, while maintaining the constant acceleration property that makes this case simple and analytically tractable. The table format connects the mathematical, graphical and physical interpretations.
